<h1>Solitaire game</h1>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<h3>Problem statement</h3>
<h4>Hypothesis</h4>
<p>Solitaire game implementations are generally created as an exercise, when learning Algorithms and Data Structures</p>
<p>The resulting implementations are typically not especially object oriented and tend not to be neither readable, maintainable nor flexible (e.g. reusable)</p>
<p>Further, the implementations tend not to be covered with automated tests, typically leaving the (student)programmer with low confidence in changing and or experimenting with the implementation</p>
<p>This Solitaire game implementation will instead be an exercise in object oriented analysis and design, resulting in a set of readable, maintainable and flexible domain abstractions, with a fairly high test coverage, facilitating confidence in changing the implementation (e.g. introducing design patterns instead of "smells")</p>
<p>All code aspects which are not directly tied to compiler and or runtime environment, and which is not directly intellegible by "everyone and anyone", shall be covered with enough readable and maintainable automated tests, that if they break as a result of refactoring etc. a test will break as well.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Highly maintainable and adaptable domain abstractions, e.g. playing card, deck of cards, pile of cards, game rule abstractions</li>
    <li>Domain abstractions shall adhere to the "Low representational gap"/"Low Semantic Gap" concept, resulting in classes with state, behaviour and attributes directly mappable to real world concepts (well argumented for exceptions may occur)</li>
    <li>High degree of automated test (unit- and integration- ) coverage, facilitating refactoring and confidence in introducing changes, without breaking behavior in adjacent areas</li>
    <li>Domain abstractions shall be decoupled from visualizations, in order to be able to change/replace them individually</li>

</ul>
